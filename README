*****************************
What "nnet_port_guard" does?
*****************************

If you have a remote server, probably SSH is open. Hackers know that and make SSH
attacks to your server. There are some ways to protect like IPTABLES but if your 
SSH port is keep open, attacks will continue. Your CPU will busy to answer them.

What if SSH port is closed? No open port, no attack. 
This is why this program created.

If you install "nnet_port_guard" program to your remote server, you can Turn on 
or OFF SSH Daemon remotely.
So you can protect against SSH attacks.

****************************************************
Schematic:
"nnet_port_guard" > --------- (Nanonet) ---------- <"web interface"

"nnet_port_guard" program first reads NodeID and UidKey from conf file, 
than connect to a Realtime Server named "Nanonet". 
(web address is http://www.otermo.com) 
Than wait for commands. 
*****************************************************
**You must run as root (sudo) it to control SSH daemon**
*****************************************************

Control interface is a web application written html and Javascript code.
Under "web" directory there is a file named "nnet_port_guard.html". 
Open it on any web browser, click "Edit Keys" and "Load Demo Keys" than "Save". 
(or on web: http://otermo.com/RTN/dosyalar/nnet_port_guard/nnet_port_guard.html)
This process save demo keys to your web browser's local storage. 
Click "Connect" button to connect "Nanonet" Realtime server. 
Than you can send commands to your server over "Nanonet" and can control your remote 
SSH daemon anywhere.

If "Nanonet" server connection disconnected for any reasons, "nnet_port_guard" 
program automatically opens SSH daemon.

Connection is encrypted.

This programs has demo keys, and points to one of my server. For demo you can 
control it.

To have your private connection on "Nanonet" please email me: nnet.server[at]gmail.com 
and get your NodeID and UidKey. (it is free) 

Paste these keys both:
1. "nnet_port_guard.conf" under "src" (you should restart "nnet_port_guard") 
2. open "nnet_port_guard.html" in a web browser and click "Edit Keys".

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tested on Ubuntu and Raspbian
Program uses this system commands:
"service ssh start"
"service ssh stop"
"service ssh status"

if your OS not have "service" command, try
/etc/init.d/ssh start, stop or status
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

*****************************

chmod +x autogen.sh
./autogen.sh
./configure

and

"nnet_port_guard" program needs config file :"nnet_port_guard.conf"
if you "make install", "nnet_port_guard" program install to system bin and 
config file "nnet_port_guard.conf" copy to /etc/nnet_port_guard/

if you just "make" these files keeps local.

Program first try to find config file in localdir, than try 
/etc/nnet_port_guard/ 
If can not find it, halt.

To run program in console 
    $x > nnet_port_guard
To run in background (daemonize) 
    $x > nnet_port_guard -d
or 
    $x > nnet_port_guard --help

if you wish program to start in boot automatically you can search rc.local or
update-rc stuff...

Some things
*****************************
Web interface can run from local. You dont need to put its files to a web server. 
Tested on Chrome and Firefox, but IE can have problems about localStorage 
when local run.
